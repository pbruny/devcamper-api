# DevCamper API

This API is build along the course Node.js API Masterclass from Brad Traversy, udemy instructor.

This readme will be updated as I go forward through the course. All the code, requirements and examples will be here. Soon, a front-end will be created as well.

If you want to run and explore the code as it is, please run:
### `npm install` 
with all dependencies (dev dependencies also), fill `.env.example` with your PORT and change the file to `.env` and run 
### `npm run dev`
Your server will be up and running.
